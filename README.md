The game will represent an otaku bloodline, survival is important but so is having fun isnt it. 
this game will feature:
-the sims way of gameplay
-multiple ways u can make money as a teen otaku 
-multiple career tree and aspiration
-skill points u invest in urself(teen) and later as an adult
e.g: gaming skills, then each gaming skill have another skill branch:
e.g: rhyme game will have u fast reflexes and predicting recognizeable rhyme pattern, fighting game will have u understandings of the game mechanic,
racing game will need u to understand track tricks and advantagous sharp turns, etc. 
when u hit the adult phase there would be several option such as:
-continue as a mangaka cuz u make doujins in ur teen
-continue as a gamedev cuz u master games in ur teen
-and more, basically a career that matches ur otaku's interest would have an income boost. 
Although there would be challenges to climb the career ladder, therefore u need to develop a job skill tree that will boost ur income per job done/increase salary,
faster production, etc.
Yes, im planning to put in an mmorpg-like economic phases with supplies and demand, and that's what going to be ur decision when u hit the adult phase;
-work a job u dont like but promise u income
-work a job u like but dont promise u steady income
or u could predict the future's demand and supply chain through a "smartly" programmed news mechanic(ofc otakus read news).
Day/night cycle exists.
u can play game inside the game, im planning to make the game online only if u play the game inside the game
furnitures
map explorations
otaku events
marriage events
figurine investments
etc

ur first objective in the game is either to be rich and be an otaku, be an otaku and poor, not rly an otaku but rich
scoring is planned on how much u have otaku stuffs in ur home, including naughty comics u bought/invest

im developing this game by myself so dont expect a good graphic nor gameplay cuz its gon be a literal loop of life with u struggling to be the best otaku of all time(BOAT) cuz
the bloodline continues, etc.
